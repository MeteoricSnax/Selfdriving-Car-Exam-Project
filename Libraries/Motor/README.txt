Motor is the library it self.

There is a demo for the library that uses some of the methods.

The constants in the demo .ino file (motorTest.ino) is needed to make the methods of the library easier to read and understand.
There is very litte amount of code that is saved by this library, but the readability is the main focus of this.
Regrettably, i could not figure out a way to make keywords for the diferent speeds and directions.
